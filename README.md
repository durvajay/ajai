# AI / GenAI Learning Lab üöÄ

This repository is my personal learning and experimentation space for mastering Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Generative AI ‚Äî from scratch.

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: Quick Jupyter experiments
- `projects/`: Real use-case implementations
- `datasets/`: Raw/custom/processed data
- `models/`: Saved checkpoints
- `scripts/`: Command-line runners
- `logs/`: Logs from training/eval
