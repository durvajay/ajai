# 🧠 AI / GenAI Learning Lab

Welcome to my personal AI/GenAI learning workspace. This repository documents my journey into designing, training, and fine-tuning AI models — from scratch — using Python and PyTorch.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- ✅ Learn the foundations of neural networks and deep learning
- ✅ Create custom datasets and build models tailored to specific use cases
- ✅ Design and train small-scale LLMs and task-specific models
- ✅ Build intuition around architecture design, tokenization, embeddings, and fine-tuning
- ✅ Leverage the open-source ecosystem (Hugging Face, PyTorch, etc.) effectively
